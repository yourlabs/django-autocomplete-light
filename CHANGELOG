    BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY BREAK

    There was a bug which caused registering an autocomplete with a model
    attribute to be renamed by the registry to prefix the autocomplete name
    with the model name. This should not be the case anymore, but some
    autocomplete names might have changed in your project if you've been
    working around that bug by using the buggy name rather than forcing name=
    uppon registration. Example:

    class Foo(YourBaseAutocomplete):
        model = Bar
    autocomplete_light.register(Foo)

    The above example Would cause 'FooBar' to be registered, but now it's just
    'Foo' as expected. So if you're using 'FooBar' instead of 'Foo' anywhere it
    should break. See #323 / 255263e61 for gory details.

    DEPRECATION WARNING

    Because Django 1.9 is so sharp on import, ``import autocomplete_light``
    should become ``import autocomplete_light.shortcuts as autocomplete_light``
    in your projects. Backward compatibility will be maintained, but you don't
    get all the shortcuts from ``import autocomplete_light`` anymore starting
    Django 1.9.

    - Django 1.8, 1.9 support: fixed warnings, use pytest-django
    - #383: Support ModelForms without Meta.model
    - #313: Model not acquired from AutocompleteModelBase
    - #323: Only derivate the autocomplete name if both model and autocomplete
      are passed
    - #378: Be friendly with special html chars in values (David Aurelio)
    - #381: The "open parentheses" (shift+9) cannot be typed on autocomplete
      field.
    - #380: PyPy support: PyPy2 tests passes without genericm2m and without
      taggit.  PyPy3 tests won't run because lxml won't install. (Piet Delport)
    - #374: Update clear-fix with latest version,
    - Also Daniel Hahler made an outstanding job in the test area, builds are a
      lot faster, using tox, pytest-django.
    - Daniel Hahler is the second owner of YourLabs org, way to go !

    So we got 7 bugs fixed, PyPy support, Django 1.8 and Django 1.9 support (we
    support 1.4 to 1.9 now).
    
    Thanks a lot to Daniel Hahler for having couch-hosted me the last 7 days in
    Berlin, we've been hacking like crazy, it was really awesome, I went there
    for some hacking and now I know I have a friend for life.

    See you for the next django-autocomplete-light sprint ;) Who's hosting BTW

2.0.0a1:

    - Fix #168: ensure that autocompletion inputs behaves like django
      when it comes to values that were removed from the queryset.

2.0.0pre:

    There are minor backward compatibility breaks due to the
    reorganization of form classes. The best way to upgrade is to
    inherit from autocomplete_light.ModelForm.

    - autocomplete_light.FixedModelForm was renamed to
      autocomplete_light.SelectMultipleHelpTextRemovalMixin and is now
      a mixin for ModelForm. Inherit from both that and
      django.forms.ModelForm to get the same.
    - GenericModelForm was renamed to
      GenericM2MRelatedObjectDescriptorHandlingMixin and is now a mixin
      for ModelForm. Inherit from both that and django.forms.ModelForm
      to get the same.
    - get_widgets_dict is gone, because we now favor using form fields
      which do validation where it's due: on POST.
    - using widgets should still work, but using the new form fields is
      better because it enables DRY validation: you don't have to
      hardcode the queryset on the form field definition anymore.

    To fix those, just inherit from autocomplete_light.ModelForm if
    possible, else check the form API details in the source or 
    generated API documentation:

    - http://django-autocomplete-light.readthedocs.org/en/v2/form.html#module-autocomplete_light.forms

    New features:

    - Added form fields, which are now in charge of validation,
    - Added ModelForm which includes all features previously provided as
      separated tools (generic m2m support, django issue #9321, etc, etc ...)
      and overrides django's form field generator to automatically use
      autocomplete fields when possible, even for generic relations.
    - Python3 support.
    - Tests rely on apps provided in the autocomplete_light.tests.apps
      submodule instead of those provided by test_project. This make tests
      potentially runnable on a user project (except that the user project
      still needs to add those apps in INSTALLED_APPS).

1.1.28 Regression fix: hide choiceDetail and choiceUpdate from the autocomplete
       box.

This fixes the default model template, see in test_project:

    http://localhost:8000/admin/default_template_autocomplete/testmodel/add/

       lot !

1.0.14 Added support for custom javascript initialization on autocomplete
       creation, ie. inlines.

       It is backward compatible, but you should migrate your custom javascript
       to:

       0) Use $(document).bind('yourlabsWidgetReady', ...) instead of
          $(document).ready(...) to initialize autocomplete widgets
       1) Use
          $('.autocomplete-light-widget[data-bootstrap=...]').live('initialize', ...)
          to instanciate autocomplete widgets instead of
          $('.autocomplete-light-widget[data-bootstrap=...]').each(...)

       See docs or remote.js for an example.

1.0.13 Use HTML5 placeholder, javascript API support for cloned widgets.

1.0.12 Fixed a crash when yourlabsAutocomplete was called on no element, fixed
       div id and removed debug statement.

1.0.11 Fugbix AutocompleteRestModel could not rely only on uniques, so it
       relies on get_or_create_by in that case

1.0.10 Fugbix models with a non numerical pk where not accepted anymore by a
       spec, the spec was removed from tests and this case is fixed.

1.0.9 Bugfix in remote autocomplete

1.0.8 Fixed keyboard navigation, 1.0.7 broke tests

1.0.7 Tested support for autocompletes that depend on each other.

1.0.6 Enhancement: set class 'autocomplete-light-widget' to autocomplete outer
                   containers created by widget.js

1.0.5 Enhancement: made rest model local object fetcher less harsh when trying
                   to find a local object

1.0.4 Bugfix: registering a generic autocomplete with a custom name did not
              use the custom name

1.0.3 Default search_names to 'name' if the model has a name field

1.0.2 Bugfix & refactor django admin + popup

1.0.1 Slight ergonomy improvement

1.0.0 (Almost) full rewrite

    - "Channel" is gone in favor of "Autocomplete"
    - More unit tests and new selenium tests
    - Javascript rewrite, for consistency and documentation
    - New view on /autocomplete_light/ allows admins to view the registry

0.6 No pity for insane bloat removal

    Backward compatibility break: {% autocomplete_light_static %} was removed.
    Instead, use {% include 'autocomplete_light/static.html' %} as demonstrated
    in the "Quick start" documentation.

    Note that autocomplete_light/static.html does not include
    cities_light/autocomplete.js, so you have to load it yourself now.

0.5

    No backward compatibility break.

    - Bugfix in generic channel example: demonstrate how to query_filter on
      multiple queryset types.
    - Bugfix in GenericForeignKeyField: allow none value.
    - Enhancement: autocomplete_light.contrib.generic_m2m supports generic many
      to many relations.
    - Enhancement: allow registration of model with custom channel attributes,
      this allows to register a model with another "search_name" than "name"
      without subclassing.
    - Documentation improvements.
