    - Renamed .div class to .block, backward compatibility is preserved.

2.0.0a1:

    - Fix #168: ensure that autocompletion inputs behaves like django
      when it comes to values that were removed from the queryset.

2.0.0pre:

    There are minor backward compatibility breaks due to the
    reorganization of form classes. The best way to upgrade is to
    inherit from autocomplete_light.ModelForm.

    - autocomplete_light.FixedModelForm was renamed to
      autocomplete_light.SelectMultipleHelpTextRemovalMixin and is now
      a mixin for ModelForm. Inherit from both that and
      django.forms.ModelForm to get the same.
    - GenericModelForm was renamed to
      GenericM2MRelatedObjectDescriptorHandlingMixin and is now a mixin
      for ModelForm. Inherit from both that and django.forms.ModelForm
      to get the same.
    - get_widgets_dict is gone, because we now favor using form fields
      which do validation where it's due: on POST.
    - using widgets should still work, but using the new form fields is
      better because it enables DRY validation: you don't have to
      hardcode the queryset on the form field definition anymore.

    To fix those, just inherit from autocomplete_light.ModelForm if
    possible, else check the form API details in the source or 
    generated API documentation:

    - http://django-autocomplete-light.readthedocs.org/en/v2/form.html#module-autocomplete_light.forms

    New features:

    - Added form fields, which are now in charge of validation,
    - Added ModelForm which includes all features previously provided as
      separated tools (generic m2m support, django issue #9321, etc, etc ...)
      and overrides django's form field generator to automatically use
      autocomplete fields when possible, even for generic relations.
    - Python3 support.
    - Tests rely on apps provided in the autocomplete_light.tests.apps
      submodule instead of those provided by test_project. This make tests
      potentially runnable on a user project (except that the user project
      still needs to add those apps in INSTALLED_APPS).

    - BC Break: Default split_words to False again, to **not** match behaviour

       box.

       lot !

1.0.14 Added support for custom javascript initialization on autocomplete
       creation, ie. inlines.

       It is backward compatible, but you should migrate your custom javascript
       to:

       0) Use $(document).bind('yourlabsWidgetReady', ...) instead of
          $(document).ready(...) to initialize autocomplete widgets
       1) Use
          $('.autocomplete-light-widget[data-bootstrap=...]').live('initialize', ...)
          to instanciate autocomplete widgets instead of
          $('.autocomplete-light-widget[data-bootstrap=...]').each(...)

       See docs or remote.js for an example.

1.0.13 Use HTML5 placeholder, javascript API support for cloned widgets.

1.0.12 Fixed a crash when yourlabsAutocomplete was called on no element, fixed
       div id and removed debug statement.

1.0.11 Fugbix AutocompleteRestModel could not rely only on uniques, so it
       relies on get_or_create_by in that case

1.0.10 Fugbix models with a non numerical pk where not accepted anymore by a
       spec, the spec was removed from tests and this case is fixed.

1.0.9 Bugfix in remote autocomplete

1.0.8 Fixed keyboard navigation, 1.0.7 broke tests

1.0.7 Tested support for autocompletes that depend on each other.

1.0.6 Enhancement: set class 'autocomplete-light-widget' to autocomplete outer
                   containers created by widget.js

1.0.5 Enhancement: made rest model local object fetcher less harsh when trying
                   to find a local object

1.0.4 Bugfix: registering a generic autocomplete with a custom name did not
              use the custom name

1.0.3 Default search_names to 'name' if the model has a name field

1.0.2 Bugfix & refactor django admin + popup

1.0.1 Slight ergonomy improvement

1.0.0 (Almost) full rewrite

    - "Channel" is gone in favor of "Autocomplete"
    - More unit tests and new selenium tests
    - Javascript rewrite, for consistency and documentation
    - New view on /autocomplete_light/ allows admins to view the registry

0.6 No pity for insane bloat removal

    Backward compatibility break: {% autocomplete_light_static %} was removed.
    Instead, use {% include 'autocomplete_light/static.html' %} as demonstrated
    in the "Quick start" documentation.

    Note that autocomplete_light/static.html does not include
    cities_light/autocomplete.js, so you have to load it yourself now.

0.5

    No backward compatibility break.

    - Bugfix in generic channel example: demonstrate how to query_filter on
      multiple queryset types.
    - Bugfix in GenericForeignKeyField: allow none value.
    - Enhancement: autocomplete_light.contrib.generic_m2m supports generic many
      to many relations.
    - Enhancement: allow registration of model with custom channel attributes,
      this allows to register a model with another "search_name" than "name"
      without subclassing.
    - Documentation improvements.
