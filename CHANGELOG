    - #628: Do not rely on ids to fix container text
    - #631: Initializing GFKs with values from forms
    - #623: Fix setup.py extras by @ticosax
    - #610: Cancel out Django's style on lists

3.1.1 Forgot vendor files in 3.1.0

3.1.0

    - ! BC BREAK ! CreateModelField is gone, it didn't work when another field
      of the form didn't validate. There isn't a really sane way to create the
      option in the form field field. Instead, this is done in the view, like
      in DAL v2.
    - ! BC BREAK ! dal_tagulous was removed in favor of django-tagging, because
      tagulous already provides its implementation of a select2 widget.
    - #610 Fixed a rendering issue with multiple selects. Upstream patch
      proposed but not merged yet: select2/select2#4226

    For details about the current status and plan, please consult the
    announcement:

    http://blog.yourlabs.org/post/140477620808/django-autocomplete-light-v3-whats-going-on

3.0.4 #586 Prune select2 docs by @eraldo

3.0.3 #586 Include all in MANIFEST by @eraldo

3.0.2 #575 Prevent Django admin from setting up jQuery with noConflict

3.0.1 #573 Updated MANIFEST to include static files.

3.0.0 Rewrite: easier to use, test, maintain and support.

2.3.3

    - #563 Don't disable multiplechoicewidgets if select is [multiple]
    - Don't import anything in __init__ anymore if on django 1.9
    - test_project fixes, for the above.

2.3.2 JAL#20 Don't disable multiplechoicewidgets by @JaHicks

2.3.1 Forgot the static files in 2.3.0.

2.3.0

    - #555 Django 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 deprecation
    - #497 Enable registration by model-name by @luzfcb
    - #536 #551 Support proxy models by @onrik
    - #553 improved jQuery integration by @blueyed
    - #516 Corrected french transation by @apinsard
    - #541 Use error_messages on FieldBase to allow overrides by @dsanders11
    - #505 Ordering alias clash fix by @sandroden
    - #515 Polish translation update by @mpasternak
    - #543 ModelChoiceField requires the queryset argument
    - #494 ModelChoiceField Watch changes to 'queryset' by @jonashaag
    - #514 Fixed deprecation warning on Django 1.8 by @spookylukey
    - #498 #548 improved i18n support
    - #547 prevents loading genericm2m if not in INSTALLED_APPS
    - JAL#18 Fix: Get value.length while value is null by @hongquan
    - JAL#19 Clarify license by @stevellis, all MIT
    - JAL#17 Disable the widget input when it is not in use @dsanders11
    - JAL#15 Support openning results in new tab @thebao
    - JAL#14 Don't autohilight first choice by default @pandabuilder
    - JAL#13 Add option for box aligning with right edge of input @dsanders11

IMPORTANT

#536 At this point, proxy model support is untested, this is because I intend
to refactor the test suite and documentation during the 2.3.x serie.

#494 Updating the queryset from outside the autocomplete class may lead to a
security problem, ie. if you don't replicate filters you apply manually on the
autocomplete object choices into choices_for_request() then a malicious user
could see choices which they shouldn't by querying the autocomplete directly.
3.0.0 will have automatic widget and / or field (in cases like gfk/gm2m)
registration to the view like in django-select2 using queryset.query caching
which would resolve that use-case.

It's a pretty big release and I waited a while because I wanted all
contributors to benefit from it and work on the same codebase instead of
privileging one to another, not sure if it was the best way, let me know !

2.2.9, 2.2.10

    [JAL] #12: Use exisiting input value for initial autocomplete query
    #503: Fix Django 1.9 import error.
    2.2.9 release has not the updated AUTHORS and lacks note about #503 in
    CHANGELOG, re-uploading as 2.2.10.

2.2.8

    #478, #472: "change related button" isn't clickable when it shouldn't.

2.2.7

    yourlabs/jquery-autocomplete-light#11: jqXHR.abort considered harmful,
    @dsanders11 fixes BrokenPipe.
    yourlabs/jquery-autocomplete-light#10: consistency fix: use $ instead
    of jQuery for new functions by @dsanders11
    yourlabs/jquery-autocomplete-light#9: New parameter to disable
    auto-hilighting on first choice #9 by @superzazu, should fix #495 too.
    #477: Widget's render should use attrs even when created wthing __init__ by
    @sandroden.

2.2.6

    jquery-autocomplete-light/#8: Positionning bug fix by @marianobianchi,
    jquery-autocomplete-light/#6: Bugfix: Firefox won't hide input after
    reload
    when option was selected by @marianobianchi,
    #483: German translation by Mounir Messelmeni
    #476, #474, #482, documentation improvements by Mounir, Visgean Skeloru and
    Florentin Hennecker.

2.2.5

    #452 Fix the case where there is a cap in the pg table or column name
    #454: AutocompleteModel.order_by being a list would crash.

2.2.4

    #463 Update jquery-autocomplete-light which contains IE8 fixes.
    yourlabs/jquery-autocomplete-light#4 by @RaphaelKimmig.

2.2.3

    #447: Ambiguous column names strikes again. This time we're using the
    .column field attribute and covered a couple of cases including model
    inheritance.
    yourlabs/jquery-autocomplete-light#4 fixed clearInputOnSelectChoice
    behaviour by @RaphaelKimmig:

    - by clearing autocomplete.value as well as input.val we make sure that
      subsequent clicks will not open the autocomplete filtered by a value that
      is no longer visible to the user
    - by clearing the input before triggering the focus we make sure the
      minimumCharacters settings is honored

2.2.2

    #422: Ambiguous column names in AutocompleteModelBase.
    Also removed a generic exception expect/pass.

2.2.1

    Django 1.8 admin support hacks broke create_choices_on_the_fly example and
    probably some other wicked JS things in user projects.

    Note that we have also extracted django admin specific hooks from widget.js
    into django_admin.js. So if you have custom JS loading in the admin instead
    of `{% include 'autocomplete_light/static.html' %}` then you should update
    it to include django_admin.js in django admin.

2.2.0

    - #318: Remove extra spaces rendered in choices.
    - #438: Hide autocomplete on scroll in Firefox because it bugs (temp fix).
    - #432: New bootstrap_modal test_app by @lucky-user.
    - #118: Extracted JS into a standalone jquery-plugin:
            https://github.com/yourlabs/jquery-autocomplete-light

2.2.0rc8

    - #408: Django admin's new edit link was implemented in such a way that
      it's unable to generate itself properly server-side on initial rendering.

2.2.0rc7

    - call fixPosition() on window resize if the autocomplete box is shown.

2.2.0rc6

    - #431 strikes again, default to body when it can't find a relevant
      container.

2.2.0rc5

    - Reduce default latency because hardware is better.
    - #431: Dynamic evaluation of the autocomp box container.

2.2.0rc4

    @lucky-user contributed Opera/Chromium improved support.

2.2.0rc3

    - #429: handle required=True in form fields again, regression introduced
      in rc1's python BC break.
    - #426: handle z-index since we're absolutely-positioning in 2.2.x

Thanks a lot to the rc tester community

2.2.0rc2

    - #425: fixed blunt JS errors.
    - Do not add pip debug log (~/.cache/pip/log/debug.log) to Travis cache.
    - Just install 'pip>7', potentially using an updated version on Travis.
    - Use travis_retry with "pip install", and also for `npm install`.

2.2.0rc1

    PENDING BREAK WARNING, Django >= 1.9.

    The good old ``import autocomplete_light`` API support will be dropped with
    Django 1.9. All imports have moved to ``autocomplete_light.shortcuts`` and
    importing ``autocomplete_light`` will work until the project is used with
    Django 1.9.

    To be forward compatible with Django master (>=1.9) support, replace::

        import autocomplete_light

    By:

        from autocomplete_light import shortcuts as al

    This will also make your scripts a lot shorter.

    CSS BREAK

    We've moved back to pre-1.1.10 CSS positioning. This means appending the
    autocomplete box to an arbitrary DOM element (body by default) and using
    calculating the ``top`` and ``bottom`` attribute in javascript with
    ``yourlabs.Autocomplete.fixPosition()`` pretty much like Django admin's
    calendar widget does. While blunt, this change should help the widget being
    more compatible across Django admin themes.

    While this positioning system has been used since around 2005 in Django
    when Adrian Holovaty open sourced admin media in commit dd5320d, it has
    never been documented that's it's a good system that works well and there's
    no reason to break backward compatibility in Django admin for that
    - note to Django admin template customizers.

    JS BREAK

    Javascript ``yourlabs.Autocomplete`` object does not bind to the same
    events as it used too. Event handling has been backported from twitter
    typeahead and tested on firefox and android (#411).

    PYTHON BREAK

    The form field doesn't call ``super().validate()`` anymore and now
    completely relies on ``AutocompleteInterface.validate_values()``. This was
    how ``django-autocomplete-light`` was initially designed for, kudos to
    @zhiyajun11 for pointing it out ! This optimises code which was doing
    validation twice and gives the flexibility it was initially designed for
    from within the Autocomplete class (#410).

    SQL BREAK

    Model Autocompletes now generate custom SQL be able to save the order in
    which users have filled an autocomplete field. This actually comes from the
    last 2.x version.

    CHANGES

    Most users won't notice the break except maybe the CSS ones and of course
    also for Django 1.9 users.

    - #419: ANSI SQL compliance (@sbaum)
    - #413: Exception when using models having primary key names different from
      id.
    - #412: Support models with a pk different than "id" and non-numeric.
      (@mhuailin)
    - #411: Android compatibility (js bind changes).
    - #410: Removed double validation by not calling suport of ``Field.validate()``.
    - #408: Support Django 1.8 change-link.
    - #409: Compatibility with non-autocomplete inputs present in the widget
      (@SebCorbin)

    CONTRIBUTING CHANGES

    Pip wheel has been temporarely disabled because django-autoslug broke it,
    any help here is welcome, I did my best in the various fix/*wheel*
    branches but Travis won xD
    There's a  mission to extract the JS part and package it as a standalone
    jQuery library to get more pull requests on the JS / CSS part. It sounds
    like a pretty good start in the JS / UI testing and packaging world. Any
    help there is welcome.
    CI now has tests against MySQL and PostgreSQL since we're generating custom
    SQL.

    Again welcome to new contributors @mhuailin and @SebCorbin and thanks all
    for reporting issues on GitHub with all needed details and forks which make
    it easy to reproduce.

    And thanks to @blueyed who helped sinking this year's backlog like crazy.

2.1.1 Not sure how the 2.1.0 release got on PyPi, marked "hidden", bumping and
      uploading a new version rather than removing it as it might have already
      been deployed somewhere.

2.1.0 Final release.

2.1.0rc4

    - #331: Fixed reverse order of items in deck, by @smcoll.

2.1.0rc3

    - PEP396: autocomplete_light.__version__.
    - #401: Easy to subclass FieldBase for custom ModelChoiceField (@smcoll),
    - #397: Support defining Meta in a ModelForm's parent.
    - #394: Add comment about keyCode issue with Webkit; check for charCode==0

2.1.0rc2: Maintain BC again in autocomplete_light ns until dj19

2.1.0rc1: Friendship release

    BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY BREAK

    There was a bug which caused registering an autocomplete with a model
    attribute to be renamed by the registry to prefix the autocomplete name
    with the model name. This should not be the case anymore, but some
    autocomplete names might have changed in your project if you've been
    working around that bug by using the buggy name rather than forcing name=
    uppon registration. Example:

    class Foo(YourBaseAutocomplete):
        model = Bar
    autocomplete_light.register(Foo)

    The above example Would cause 'FooBar' to be registered, but now it's just
    'Foo' as expected. So if you're using 'FooBar' instead of 'Foo' anywhere it
    should break. See #323 / 255263e61 for gory details.

    DEPRECATION WARNING

    Because Django 1.9 is so sharp on import, ``import autocomplete_light``
    should become ``import autocomplete_light.shortcuts as autocomplete_light``
    in your projects. Backward compatibility will be maintained, but you don't
    get all the shortcuts from ``import autocomplete_light`` anymore starting
    Django 1.9.

    - Django 1.8, 1.9 support: fixed warnings, use pytest-django
    - #383: Support ModelForms without Meta.model
    - #313: Model not acquired from AutocompleteModelBase
    - #323: Only derivate the autocomplete name if both model and autocomplete
      are passed
    - #378: Be friendly with special html chars in values (David Aurelio)
    - #381: The "open parentheses" (shift+9) cannot be typed on autocomplete
      field.
    - #380: PyPy support: PyPy2 tests passes without genericm2m and without
      taggit.  PyPy3 tests won't run because lxml won't install. (Piet Delport)
    - #374: Update clear-fix with latest version,
    - Also Daniel Hahler made an outstanding job in the test area, builds are a
      lot faster, using tox, pytest-django.
    - Daniel Hahler is the second owner of YourLabs org, way to go !

    So we got 7 bugs fixed, PyPy support, Django 1.8 and Django 1.9 support (we
    support 1.4 to 1.9 now).

    Thanks a lot to Daniel Hahler for having couch-hosted me the last 7 days in
    Berlin, we've been hacking like crazy, it was really awesome, I went there
    for some hacking and now I know I have a friend for life.

    See you for the next django-autocomplete-light sprint ;) Who's hosting BTW

      the old style back, include autocomplete_light/old_style.css.

2.0.0a1:

    - Fix #168: ensure that autocompletion inputs behaves like django
      when it comes to values that were removed from the queryset.

2.0.0pre:

    There are minor backward compatibility breaks due to the
    reorganization of form classes. The best way to upgrade is to
    inherit from autocomplete_light.ModelForm.

    - autocomplete_light.FixedModelForm was renamed to
      autocomplete_light.SelectMultipleHelpTextRemovalMixin and is now
      a mixin for ModelForm. Inherit from both that and
      django.forms.ModelForm to get the same.
    - GenericModelForm was renamed to
      GenericM2MRelatedObjectDescriptorHandlingMixin and is now a mixin
      for ModelForm. Inherit from both that and django.forms.ModelForm
      to get the same.
    - get_widgets_dict is gone, because we now favor using form fields
      which do validation where it's due: on POST.
    - using widgets should still work, but using the new form fields is
      better because it enables DRY validation: you don't have to
      hardcode the queryset on the form field definition anymore.

    To fix those, just inherit from autocomplete_light.ModelForm if
    possible, else check the form API details in the source or
    generated API documentation:

    - https://django-autocomplete-light.readthedocs.io/en/v2/form.html#module-autocomplete_light.forms

    New features:

    - Added form fields, which are now in charge of validation,
    - Added ModelForm which includes all features previously provided as
      separated tools (generic m2m support, django issue #9321, etc, etc ...)
      and overrides django's form field generator to automatically use
      autocomplete fields when possible, even for generic relations.
    - Python3 support.
    - Tests rely on apps provided in the autocomplete_light.tests.apps
      submodule instead of those provided by test_project. This make tests
      potentially runnable on a user project (except that the user project
      still needs to add those apps in INSTALLED_APPS).

1.4.9: Fix #193: IE8 support hacks.

1.4.8: Fix #195: RegistryView got broken on recent Django versions.

1.4.7:

    - Fix #190: Remove Django 1.6 Depreciation Warning,

    - BC Break: Default split_words to False again, to **not** match behaviour

       lot !

1.0.14 Added support for custom javascript initialization on autocomplete
       creation, ie. inlines.

       It is backward compatible, but you should migrate your custom javascript
       to:

       0) Use $(document).bind('yourlabsWidgetReady', ...) instead of
          $(document).ready(...) to initialize autocomplete widgets
       1) Use
          $('.autocomplete-light-widget[data-bootstrap=...]').live('initialize', ...)
          to instanciate autocomplete widgets instead of
          $('.autocomplete-light-widget[data-bootstrap=...]').each(...)

       See docs or remote.js for an example.

1.0.13 Use HTML5 placeholder, javascript API support for cloned widgets.

1.0.12 Fixed a crash when yourlabsAutocomplete was called on no element, fixed
       div id and removed debug statement.

1.0.11 Fugbix AutocompleteRestModel could not rely only on uniques, so it
       relies on get_or_create_by in that case

1.0.10 Fugbix models with a non numerical pk where not accepted anymore by a
       spec, the spec was removed from tests and this case is fixed.

1.0.9 Bugfix in remote autocomplete

1.0.8 Fixed keyboard navigation, 1.0.7 broke tests

1.0.7 Tested support for autocompletes that depend on each other.

1.0.6 Enhancement: set class 'autocomplete-light-widget' to autocomplete outer
                   containers created by widget.js

1.0.5 Enhancement: made rest model local object fetcher less harsh when trying
                   to find a local object

1.0.4 Bugfix: registering a generic autocomplete with a custom name did not
              use the custom name

1.0.3 Default search_names to 'name' if the model has a name field

1.0.2 Bugfix & refactor django admin + popup

1.0.1 Slight ergonomy improvement

1.0.0 (Almost) full rewrite

    - "Channel" is gone in favor of "Autocomplete"
    - More unit tests and new selenium tests
    - Javascript rewrite, for consistency and documentation
    - New view on /autocomplete_light/ allows admins to view the registry

0.6 No pity for insane bloat removal

    Backward compatibility break: {% autocomplete_light_static %} was removed.
    Instead, use {% include 'autocomplete_light/static.html' %} as demonstrated
    in the "Quick start" documentation.

    Note that autocomplete_light/static.html does not include
    cities_light/autocomplete.js, so you have to load it yourself now.

0.5

    No backward compatibility break.

    - Bugfix in generic channel example: demonstrate how to query_filter on
      multiple queryset types.
    - Bugfix in GenericForeignKeyField: allow none value.
    - Enhancement: autocomplete_light.contrib.generic_m2m supports generic many
      to many relations.
    - Enhancement: allow registration of model with custom channel attributes,
      this allows to register a model with another "search_name" than "name"
      without subclassing.
    - Documentation improvements.
