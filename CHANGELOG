1.0.9 Bugfix in remote autocomplete

1.0.8 Fixed keyboard navigation, 1.0.7 broke tests

1.0.7 Tested support for autocompletes that depend on each other.

1.0.6 Enhancement: set class 'autocomplete-light-widget' to autocomplete outer
                   containers created by widget.js

1.0.5 Enhancement: made rest model local object fetcher less harsh when trying
                   to find a local object

1.0.4 Bugfix: registering a generic autocomplete with a custom name did not
              use the custom name

1.0.3 Default search_names to 'name' if the model has a name field

1.0.2 Bugfix & refactor django admin + popup

1.0.1 Slight ergonomy improvement

1.0.0 (Almost) full rewrite

    - "Channel" is gone in favor of "Autocomplete"
    - More unit tests and new selenium tests
    - Javascript rewrite, for consistency and documentation
    - New view on /autocomplete_light/ allows admins to view the registry

0.6 No pity for insane bloat removal

    Backward compatibility break: {% autocomplete_light_static %} was removed.
    Instead, use {% include 'autocomplete_light/static.html' %} as demonstrated
    in the "Quick start" documentation.

    Note that autocomplete_light/static.html does not include
    cities_light/autocomplete.js, so you have to load it yourself now.

0.5

    No backward compatibility break.

    - Bugfix in generic channel example: demonstrate how to query_filter on
      multiple queryset types.
    - Bugfix in GenericForeignKeyField: allow none value.
    - Enhancement: autocomplete_light.contrib.generic_m2m supports generic many
      to many relations.
    - Enhancement: allow registration of model with custom channel attributes,
      this allows to register a model with another "search_name" than "name"
      without subclassing.
    - Documentation improvements.
