    The type of the forwarded value from the field is either string, list of
    strings or boolean.

    The following rules are used to deduce forwarded type.

     - If there is only one field in the form or subform with name ``src``
    and this field is a checkbox without ``value`` HTML-attribute,
    then boolean value indicating if this checkbox is checked is forwarded.

     - If there is only one field in the form or subform with name ``src``
    and it has ``multiple`` HTML-attribute, then this field is forwarded as a
    list of strings, containing values from this field.

    - If there are one or more fields in the form with name ``src`` and all of
    them are checkboxes with HTML-attribute ``value`` set the list of strings
    containing checked checkboxes is forwarded.

    - Otherwise ``src`` field value forwarded as a string.

    .. py:attribute:: src

        The name of the form field whose value will be forwarded to a view.

    .. py:attribute:: dst

        The name of the key of the forwarded value from the src field in the
        forwarded dictionary. If this value is ``None``, then the key is
        ``src``.

    .. py:attribute:: strategy
        The strategy to forward this field. In most cases you should be happy
        with FieldStrategy.AUTO which is passed to the constructor as the
        default value. If you're seeing forwarded values of wrong types (e. g.
        bool value instead of list) in your autocomplete view then you should
        read :py:class:`FieldStrategy` docstring to fine-tune forwarding of
        this field.
