class FieldStrategy(object):
    """
    Enumeration with possible forward strategies for :py:class:`Field`.

    In most cases your fields should be forwarded correctly using ``AUTO``
    strategy which is passed to the :py:class:`Field` constructor as the
    default value. If you're seeing forwarded values of wrong types in your
    autocomplete view (e. g. bool value instead of list) then you should read
    further.

    To get forwarded value DAL does the following:

    - finds forwarded field(s) by name in DOM,
    - serializes fields' value using
        `jQuery.serializeArray <https://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/>`_,
        (note that implementation may change in future releases but
        this function should remain good enough for the purpose of this text)
    - based on selected strategy extracts forwarded value itself to pass
        it to the DAL view.

    So let's assume we have this pseudocode that does first two steps
    and explain all the possible strategies in terms of this pseudocode::

        // List of found fields (jQuery object)
        var fields = findFieldsByName(forwarded);

        // List of javascript objects:
        // [
        //   {
        //       "name": "forwarded",
        //       "value": "val1"
        //   },
        //   {
        //       "name": "forwarded",
        //       "value": "val2"
        //   },
        //   ...
        // ]
        var serializedData = $(fields).serializeArray();

    SINGLE
    ------

    When the ``SINGLE`` strategy is used the value forwarded to the DAL view
    is the value attribute of the first element of ``serializedData``.

    Pseudocode::

        val forwardedValue = serializedData[0].value;

    MULTIPLE
    --------

    When the ``MULTIPLE`` strategy is used the value forwarded to the DAL view
    is the value attribute of the first element of ``serializedData``.

    Pseudocode::

        val forwardedValue = serializedData.map(
            function (item) { return getValueOf(item); }
        );

    EXISTS
    ------

    When the ``EXISTS`` strategy is used the value forwarded to the DAL view
    is boolean ``true`` if ``serializedData`` is not empty, ``false`` 
    otherwise.

    Pseudocode::

        val forwardedValue = serializedData.map(
            function (item) { return getValueOf(item); }
        );


    AUTO
    ----

    When the ``AUTO`` strategy is used the forward strategy for the field
    is deduced automatically based on ``fields`` size and type of each field
    in ``fields``.

    If the length of ``fields`` is 1 and the field is checkbox without
    ``value`` attribute, then ``EXISTS`` strategy is used.

    If the length of ``fields`` is 1 and this field has ``multiple`` HTML
    attribute, then ``MULTIPLE`` strategy is used.

    If all the ``fields`` are checkboxes, then ``MULTIPLE`` strategy is used.

    Otherwise ``SINGLE`` strategy is used.
