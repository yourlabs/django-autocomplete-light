Ensure you have read the
[FAQ](http://django-autocomplete-light.readthedocs.org/en/master/faq.html).

Before opening an issue, ensure you have:

- clear steps to reproduce the bug,
- a fork of the repo with an additionnal app in test_project to reproduce your
  issue out-of-the-box.

**WARNING** We are more likely to fix/support something with an example app.

Please, do **NOT** paste partial code in the issue text, ie. only forms and
admin without models, etc, etc... Actually please don't post code at all: fork
the repo, add example app, make a PR. We are more likely to fix/support
something with an example app. If you really want to only paste code then
please use [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com).

This app belongs to everybody who wants to make it work. If you don't want to
make it work then please go to StackOverflow instead of posting an issue.

If you really don't want to contribute and want me to do all the work to solve
your problem with money, YourLabs core-dev team has quite a few freelancers
whom would be happy to help for an hourly rate of $60.
