Scripts: the javascript side of autocompletes
=============================================

.. note:: This chapter assumes that you have been through 
          :doc:`tutorial` and :doc:`autocomplete` and :doc:`form`.

Design documentation
--------------------

Before installing your own autocomplete scripts, you should know about the
humble provided scripts:

- ``autocomplete.js`` provides ``yourlabs.Autocomplete`` via the
  ``$.yourlabsAutocomplete()`` jQuery extension: add an autocomplete box to a
  text input, it can be used on its own to create a navigation autocomplete
  like facebook and all the cool kids out there.
- ``widget.js`` provides ``yourlabs.Widget`` via the ``$.yourlabsWidget()``
  jQuery extension: combine an text input with an autocomplete box with a
  django form field which is represented by a hidden ``<select>``.
- ``addanother.js`` enables adding options to a ``<select>`` via a popup from
  outside the admin, code mostly comes from Django admin BTW,
- ``remote.js`` provides ``yourlabs.RemoteAutocompleteWidget``, used extend
  ``yourlabs.Widget`` and override ``yourlabs.Widget.getValue`` to create
  choices on-the-fly.
- ``text_widget.js`` provides ``yourlabs.TextWidget``, used to manage the value
  of a text input that has an autocomplete box.

Why a new autocomplete script you might ask ? What makes this script unique is
that it relies on the server to render the contents of the autocomplete-box.
This means that you can fully design it like you want, including new HTML tags
like ``<img>``, using template tags like ``{% url %}``, and so on.

If you want to change something on the javascript side, chances are that you
will be better off overriding a method like
``yourlabs.RemoteAutocompleteWidget`` instead of installing your own script
right away.

What you need to know is that:

- widgets don't render any inline javascript: the have HTML attributes that
  will tell the scripts how to instanciate objects with ``$.yourlabsWidget()``,
  ``$.yourlabsTextWidget()`` and so on. This allows to support dynamically
  inserted widgets ie. with a dynamic formsets inside or outside of django
  admin.
- the particular attribute that is watched for is ``data-bootstrap``. If an
  HTML element with class ``.autocomplete-light-widget`` is found or created
  with ``data-bootstrap="normal"`` then ``widget.js`` will call
  ``$.yourlabsWidget``.
- if you customize ``data-bootstrap``, ``widget.js`` will not do anything and
  you are free to implement your script, either by extending a provided a
  class, either using a third-party script, either completely from scratch.

Examples
--------

django-autocomplete-light provides consistent JS plugins. A concept that
you understand for one plugin is likely to be appliable for others.

.. _navigation-autocomplete-example:

Using ``$.yourlabsAutocomplete`` to create a navigation autocomplete
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

If your website has a lot of data, it might be useful to add a search
input somewhere in the design. For example, there is a search input in
Facebook's header. You will also notice that the search input in Facebook
provides an autocomplete which allows to directly navigate to a particular
object's detail page. This allows a visitor to jump to a particular page with
very few effort.

Our autocomplete script is designed to support this kind of autocomplete. It
can be enabled on an input field and query the server for a rendered
autocomplete with anything like images and nifty design. Just create a view
that renders just a list of links based on ``request.GET.q``.

Then you can use it to make a global navigation autocomplete using
``autocomplete.js`` directly.  It can look like this:

.. code-block:: javascript
    
    // Make a javascript Autocomplete object and set it up
    var autocomplete = $('#yourInput').yourlabsAutocomplete({
        url: '{% url "your_autocomplete_url" %}',
    });

So when the user clicks on a link of the autocomplete box which is generated by
your view: it is like if he clicked on a normal link.

You've learned that you can have a fully functional navigation autocomplete
like on Facebook with just this:

.. code-block:: javascript

    $('#yourInput').yourlabsAutocomplete({
        url: '{% url "your_autocomplete_url" %}',
        choiceSelector: 'a',
    }).input.bind('selectChoice', function(e, choice, autocomplete) {
        window.location.href = choice.attr('href');
    });

``autocomplete.js`` doesn't do anything but trigger ``selectChoice`` on the
input when a choice is selected either with mouse **or keyboard**, let's enable
some action:

Because the script doesn't know what HTML the server returns, it is nice to
tell it how to recognize choices in the autocomplete box HTML::
This will allow to use the keyboard arrows up/down to navigate between choices.

Refer to :ref:`navigation` for complete help on making a navigation
autocomplete.

Overriding a JS option in Python
````````````````````````````````

Javascript widget and autocomplete objects options can be overidden via HTML
data attributes:

- ``yourlabs.Autocomplete`` will use any ``data-autocomplete-*`` attribute **on
  the input tag**,
- ``yourlabs.Widget`` will use any ``data-widget-*`` attribute **on the widget
  container**.

Those can be set in Python either with ``register()``, as Autocomplete class
attributes or as widget attributes. See next examples for details.

Per registered Autocomplete
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

These options can be set with the ``register()`` shortcut:

.. code-block:: python

    autocomplete_light.register(Person,
        attrs={
            'placeholder': 'foo',
            'data-autocomplete-minimum-characters': 0
        },
        widget_attrs={'data-widget-maximum-values': 4}
    )

Per Autocomplete class
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Or equivalently on a Python Autocomplete class:

.. code-block:: python

    class YourAutocomplete(autocomplete_light.AutocompleteModelBase):
        model = Person
        attrs={
            'placeholder': 'foo',
            'data-autocomplete-minimum-characters': 0
        },
        widget_attrs={'data-widget-maximum-values': 4}

Per widget
>>>>>>>>>>

Or via the Python widget class:

.. code-block:: python

    autocomplete_light.ChoiceWidget('FooAutocomplete',
        attrs={
            'placeholder': 'foo',
            'data-autocomplete-minimum-characters': 0
        },
        widget_attrs={'data-widget-maximum-values': 4}
    )

**NOTE** the difference of the option name here. It is ``attrs`` to match
django and not ``attrs``. Note that ``Autocomplete.attrs`` might be
renamed to ``Autocomplete.attrs`` before v2 hits RC.

Override autocomplete JS options in JS
``````````````````````````````````````

The array passed to the plugin function will actually be used to $.extend the
autocomplete instance, so you can override any option, ie:

.. code-block:: javascript

    $('#yourInput').yourlabsAutocomplete({
        url: '{% url "your_autocomplete_url" %}',
        // Hide after 200ms of mouseout
        hideAfter: 200,
        // Choices are elements with data-url attribute in the autocomplete
        choiceSelector: '[data-url]',
        // Show the autocomplete after only 1 character in the input.
        minimumCharacters: 1,
        // Override the placeholder attribute in the input:
        placeholder: '{% trans 'Type your search here ...' %}',
        // Append the autocomplete HTML somewhere else:
        appendAutocomplete: $('#yourElement'),
        // Override zindex:
        autocompleteZIndex: 1000,
    });

.. note::

    The pattern is the same for all plugins provided by django-autocomplete-light.

.. _script-method-override:

Override autocomplete JS methods
````````````````````````````````

Overriding methods works the same, ie:

.. code-block:: javascript

    $('#yourInput').yourlabsAutocomplete({
        url: '{% url "your_autocomplete_url" %}',
        choiceSelector: '[data-url]',
        getQuery: function() {
            return this.input.val() + '&search_all=' + $('#searchAll').val();
        },
        hasChanged: function() {
            return true; // disable cache
        },
    });

.. note::

    The pattern is the same for all plugins provided by django-autocomplete-light.

Overload autocomplete JS methods
````````````````````````````````

Use `call
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call>`_
to call a parent method. This example automatically selects the choice if there
is only one:

.. code-block:: javascript

    $(document).ready(function() {
        var autocomplete = $('#id_city_text').yourlabsAutocomplete();
        autocomplete.show = function(html) {
            yourlabs.Autocomplete.prototype.show.call(this, html)
            var choices = this.box.find(this.choiceSelector);

            if (choices.length == 1) {
                this.input.trigger('selectChoice', [choices, this]);
            }
        }
    });

Get an existing autocomplete object and chain autocompletes
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

You can use the jQuery plugin ``yourlabsAutocomplete()`` to get an existing
autocomplete object. Which makes chaining autocompletes with other form fields
as easy as:

.. code-block:: javascript
    
    $('#country').change(function() {
        $('#yourInput').yourlabsAutocomplete().data = {
            'country': $(this).val();
        }
    });

.. _js-method-override:

Overriding widget JS methods
````````````````````````````

The widget js plugin will only bootstrap widgets which have
``data-bootstrap="normal"``. Which means that you should first name your new
bootstrapping method to ensure that the default behaviour doesn't get in the
way. 

.. code-block:: python

    autocomplete_light.register(City, 
        widget_attrs={'data-widget-bootstrap': 'your-custom-bootstrap'})

.. note::

    You could do this at various level, by setting the ``bootstrap`` argument
    on a widget instance, via ``register()`` or directly on an autocomplete
    class. See Overriding JS options in Python for details.

Now, you can instanciate the widget yourself like this:

.. code-block:: javascript

    $(document).bind('yourlabsWidgetReady', function() {
        $('.your.autocomplete-light-widget[data-bootstrap=your-custom-bootstrap]').live('initialize', function() {
            $(this).yourlabsWidget({
                // Override options passed to $.yourlabsAutocomplete() from here
                autocompleteOptions: {
                    url: '{% url "your_autocomplete_url" %}',
                    // Override any autocomplete option in this array if you want
                    choiceSelector: '[data-id]',
                },
                // Override some widget options, allow 3 choices:
                maxValues: 3,
                // or method:
                getValue: function(choice) {
                    // This is the method that returns the value to use for the
                    // hidden select option based on the HTML of the selected
                    // choice.
                    //  
                    // This is where you could make a non-async post request to
                    // this.autocomplete.url for example. The default is:
                    return choice.data('id')
                },
            })
        });
    });

You can use the remote autocomplete as an example.

.. note::

    You could of course call ``$.yourlabsWidget()`` directly, but using the
    ``yourlabsWidgetReady`` event takes advantage of the built-in
    DOMNodeInserted event: your widgets will also work with dynamically created
    widgets (ie. admin inlines).
