django-autocomplete-light's purpose is to enable autocompletes quickly and
properly in a django project: it is the fruit of **years of R&D**. It was
designed for Django so that every part overridable or reusable independently.
It is stable, tested, documented and fully supported: it tries to be a good
neighbour in Django ecosystem.

--------

Features include:

- charfield, foreign key, many to many autocomplete widgets,
- generic foreign key, generic many to many autocomplete widgets,
- django template engine support for autocompletes, enabling you to include
  images etc ...

Upgrade from 1.x.x
------------------

**To upgrade to v2**, please enjoy the `v1 to v2 upgrade instructions
<http://django-autocomplete-light.readthedocs.org/en/stable-2.x.x/1to2.html>`_
(documented with love !).

- the Autocomplete class design hasn't changed at all.
- ``yourlabsWidget()`` doesn't parses ``data-*`` options the same,
- the django/form python code has been re-organised ie.
  ``get_widgets_dict()`` is gone and ``autocomplete_light.ModelForm``
  wraps around all features by default.
- use ``autocomplete_light.ModelForm`` instead of
  ``autocomplete_light.GenericModelForm`` - generic foreign keys and
  django-generic-m2m are supported by default if installed.
