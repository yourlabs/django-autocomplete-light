django-autocomplete-light's purpose is to enable autocompletes quickly and
properly in a django project: it is the fruit of half a decade of R&D and
thousands of contributions. It was designed for Django so that every part
overridable or reusable independently. It is stable, tested, documented and
fully supported: it tries to be a good neighbour in Django ecosystem.

Projects upgrading to Django 1.9
--------------------------------

DAL has been ready for Django 1.9 since April 2015 thanks to @blueyed & @jpic.
**HOWEVER** due to the app loading refactor in 1.9 you should apply the
following::

    find . -name '*py' | xargs sed -i 's/import autocomplete_light/from autocomplete_light import shortcuts as autocomplete_light/'

See the test_project running on Django 1.9 and its new cool admin theme:
http://jpic.pythonanywhere.com/admin (test:test).
